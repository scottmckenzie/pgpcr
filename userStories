As a debian contributor,... 

I want to create a gpg keypair offline so that my master key never touches my hard drive

I don't want to touch gpg directly or try to follow some long-winded online guide so that I can save time

I want to use any random external storage I might have lying around so that I can save money

I want to be able to sign other people's keys so that I can be part of the web of trust

I want to put my subkeys on a smartcard, so that even they aren't on my hard drive
