Running locally
---------------
If you want to help debug or develop this application, it might be useful to run it locally.
In order to do so you need to first run:
```
export PYTHONPATH=`pwd`/..
```

Or your shell equivalent to add pgpcr's parent directory to the python module search path.

After that, you can run:
```
./pgp-clean-room
```

to launch the application
